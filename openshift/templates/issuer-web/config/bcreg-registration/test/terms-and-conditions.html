	<h2>Business Banking and Digital Credentials</h2>
	<p><em>Please download a <a href="https://vonx.io/getwallet" target="_blank">digital wallet</a> before using this service.</em></p>
	<p><em>Are you coming back here after getting your &quot;Verified Person&quot; credential? <a href="#next-step">Continue to step 2</a>.</em></p>
	<p>This is a Proof of Concept service. It demonstrates how individuals could be provided with secure digital &quot;credentials&quot; that prove who they are and their relationship to the business that they claim to represent. Business representatives could then present these credentials when needed in securely conducting a business transaction, such as to open a bank account.</p>
	<p>A digital credential is like a paper certificate, except it's far more secure, impossible to forge, and easy to automatically verify. For example, a digital credential doesn't require a person to manually verify its authenticity&mdash;the verification is handled automatically, using the latest digital cryptography.</p>
	<p>Digital credentials are the future of Digital Trust, and this Proof of Concept is a large step in that direction.</p>
	<h3>How this Proof of Concept works</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>You will be issued with a credential that verifies you as a <strong>person</strong>.</li>
		<li>That credential allows you to demonstrate to BC Registries that you have the &quot;Verified Person&quot; credential of the <strong>owner of an organization</strong>. As such, you can get some credentials about the organization. Notably, you will get:<br />
		<ol>
			<li>A &quot;Verifiable Organization&quot; credential that holds information about the organization.</li>
			<li>A &quot;Verified Relationship&quot; credential that holds information about your relationship to the organization&mdash;notably that you are the owner of that organization.</li>
		</ol></li>
		<li>You will then use your credentials to simulate <strong>opening a bank account</strong> online.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>All the data used in this Proof of Concept is fictitious and no real systems are used, so feel free to experiment.</p>
	<p>This Proof of Concept is being conducted by ISED and Ministry of Finance in the Government of Canada, the governments of British Columbia and Alberta, and a number of Canadian banks.</p>
	<h3>How to get started</h3>
	<p>Note: all the credentials will be stored in a digital wallet on your cell phone. Therefore, please <a href="https://vonx.io/getwallet" target="_blank">download a digital wallet</a> before proceeding.</p>
	<h4>Step 1: Verified Person Credential</h4>
	<p><a href="https://bcgov-citz-issuer-test.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca" target="_blank">Get your verified person credential (opens in a new window)</a>. When you have the credential, come back to this page for step 2.</li>
	<h4 id="next-step">Step 2: Verified Organization Credential</h4>
	<p>For the next step in this Business Banking Proof of Concept (PoC), you need a credential about your organization. You are eligible to get this credential because you have a formally defined (by BC Registries) relationship to the organization&mdash;either an &quot;owner&quot; or &quot;director&quot;.</p>
	<p>As this is a PoC, this User Experience is not at all what will happen in the Real World. Once in production, the process will be more like the following.</p>
	<p>A user will go about the process of creating a new registered entity or accessing an existing entity to which they are related. As they identify formal roles in the organization, they would identify roles that they occupy&mdash;either an owner or director. BC Registries would make the association between the identified user and the role, preventing, for example, editing information acquired from a verified source, such as the BC Services Card mobile app. Once the association is defined, the user will be offered the opportunity to be issued verified credentials about the registered entity and their relationship with the entity.</p>
	<p>With that said about how the process should work, here is how you use this PoC service.</p>
	<p>To receive a verified organization credential, you must first identify yourself to the service using the &quot;Verified Person&quot; credential you are already holding in your wallet. When you proceed you will be asked to scan a QR code that contains a request for proof of the possession of the &quot;Verified Person&quot; credential.</p>
	<p>Once the verification process is complete, you will be on a form to collect information about the registered entity. Much of it will be complete (with generated data), and some fields you will have to complete. Once done and submitted, you will see a now familiar QR code, you know what to do. Use your digital wallet app to scan the code and follow the instructions in your wallet app.</p>
